Link to Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/network-analysis-and-visualization-of-drug-drug-interactions-1e0b41d0d3df

### Context
Drug-drug interactions occur when two or more drugs react with each other, resulting in unexpected (and potentially fatal) adverse reactions.  
 
Being a data scientist with a background in clinical pharmacy, I was keen to leverage my domain knowledge to explore the data around drug interactions.  

Given that drug-drug interactions involve linkages between multiple entities, it would be apt to conduct the exploration of these drug interactions with networks at the core.

### Tools used
